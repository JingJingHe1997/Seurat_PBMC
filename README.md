# Seurat_PBMC
As a new user of Seurat, I learned scRNA-seq analysis with a guided walkthrough of a dataset of 2,700 Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells 
(PBMCs) made publicly available by 10X Genomics (download raw data, R markdown file, and final Seurat object). This tutorial implements 
the major components of the Seurat clustering workflow including QC and data filtration, calculation of high-variance genes, dimensional
reduction, graph-based clustering, and the identification of cluster markers.
